# ASCII Video Converter

This project converts videos to ASCII

---

Initially, the plan was to use **only OpenCV (`cv2`)** for the entire conversion and text rendering.  
However, **OpenCV cannot reliably use true monospace fonts** without the `freetype` module, which is not always available.  
Therefore:

- In the current version, **ASCII text is rendered using PIL (Python Imaging Library)** to ensure proper alignment of rows and columns.  
- OpenCV is mainly used for **reading and writing video** and for converting frames to/from images.
