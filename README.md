# ASCII Video Converter

This project converts videos to ASCII

---

Initially, the plan was to use **only OpenCV (`cv2`)** for the entire conversion and text rendering.  
However, **OpenCV cannot reliably use true monospace fonts** without the `freetype` module, which is not always available.  
Therefore:

- In the current version, **ASCII text is rendered using PIL (Python Imaging Library)** to ensure proper alignment of rows and columns.  
- OpenCV is mainly used for **reading and writing video** and for converting frames to/from images.

## Features

- Convert videos to ASCII art at full resolution.  
- Play ASCII videos in the console.  
- Fast and lightweight pipeline using OpenCV for video I/O and PIL for text rendering.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+  
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)  
- Pillow (`PIL`)  
- NumPy
